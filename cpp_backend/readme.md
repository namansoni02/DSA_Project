We would be working first on the cpp backend where we will leave http endpoints so that js backend can communicate with the cpp backend.

The basic file structure will be 
1) A* star algorithm ( where a matrix will be taken as input and two coordinates as start and end points and after all this the file will return the path to js backend).
2) A file which will be hosting the server ( main.cpp)
